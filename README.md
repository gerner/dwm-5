dwm
===

Here is my hacked up copy of dwm. README has the traditional dwm README file.

I have a few patches in `patches/`. Some of these are from the standard distro. But I've also added a few patches of my own:

* focusbyindex lets you choose a window by it's position in the client list
* spawnend places new windows at the end of the client list instead of at the beginning
* zoomswap swaps windows that gain focus with the master (instead of just going to the head of the list)
