ZOOM SWAPS CURRENT MASTER
=========================

Description

This patch swaps the master with whatever slave window is gaining focus. This helps to preserve the ordering of clients (e.g. for the focusbyindex patch).

Configuration
-------------

Download the patch and apply it according to the [general instructions](http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/).

It'll just work :)
